Where you place your Suspense boundaries will depend on a few things:
- How you want the user to experience the page as it streams.
- What content you want to prioritize.
- If the components rely on data fetching.

In the dashboard page, is there anything you would've done differently? Short answer there isn't a right answer.

- You could stream the whole page like we did with loading.tsx... but that may lead to a longer loading time if one of the components has a slow data fetch.
- You could stream every component individually... but that may lead to UI popping into the screen as it becomes ready.
- You could also create a staggered effect by streaming page sections. But you'll need to create wrapper components.
